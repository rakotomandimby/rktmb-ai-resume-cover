# Use paralelize requesting to the APIs 

With the current code, the requests to the APIs are made sequentially.
And they are slow. There are 2 requests to the OpenAI API and 2 requests to the Google AI API.

I want to paralelize the requests to the APIs, and adapt the EJS templates accordingly.
We must maintain the token verification before making the requests to the APIs.

Tell me the full new content of the files I need to modify to implement this feature.


# ANT Network error: No response received from the API.
